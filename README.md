# Amy-virtual-assistant
"Amy" general purpose virtual assistant for everyone. 
Hey I'm CSIE Sophomore student. 
Self learning python. 
I'm trying to make general purpose virtual assistant. Its not ai, its just a bunch of functions that is able to understand some command. 
So far there is functions that Amy can do: 
1. Telling you time. /if 'time' is in your input./
2. Open browser and play music in youtube. /if play in your input./
3. tell you information about someone or something. /if 'who is' or 'what is' in your input./
4. tell you a joke. /if 'joke' is in your input./

Please tell me more interesting functions that I can make. 
Any request, collab, discussion is open.
