# Amy-virtual-assistant"Amy" is a general-purpose virtual assistant for everyone.
Hey, I'm a CSIE sophomore student.Self-learning Python developer For this project, I used open source software.
I'm trying to make a general-purpose virtual assistant. It's not AI; it's just a bunch of functions that are able to understand some commands.
So far, there are functions that Amy can do:

  1. If you enter "time," it will tell you the time.
  2. Launch your browser and start listening to music on YouTube; if play is your input,
  3. tell you information about someone or something if you say "who is" or "what is" in your input.
  4. tell you a joke, if "joke" is in your input.
  
Please tell me about any other interesting functions that I could create.
I'm obsessed with creating virtual assistants like "Alexa" or "Siri."I haven't started learning AI. 
So we began with the easiest.After that, I want to write it in C without using any pre-built libraries.
Any collaboration or discussion request is welcome.
